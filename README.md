this was for the most part a personal endeavor, but feel free to suggestion additions
check the bepinex config for more neat options, like extra randomly filled weapon slots, arcade style features like kicking during actions and running while shooting, and more control over certain values

Once you install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), simply extract the contents of the zip into a randomly named folder in Ravenfield/BepInEx/Plugins
